Saving cluster configuration to /var/lib/ceph/ac86af9a-2fdf-11ef-8c9c-52540001326f/config directory
Skipping call home integration. --enable-ibm-call-home not provided
Enabling autotune for osd_memory_target
You can access the Ceph CLI as following in case of multi-cluster or non-default config:

        sudo /usr/sbin/cephadm shell --fsid ac86af9a-2fdf-11ef-8c9c-52540001326f -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf -k /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring

Or, if you are only running a single cluster on this host:

        sudo /usr/sbin/cephadm shell 

Please consider enabling telemetry to help improve Ceph:

        ceph telemetry on

NOTE: You may have to wait for approximately 5 to 10 minutes for all background processes for installation to complete and the cluster to be in `HEALTH_OK` state. You may track the progress with `caph -s` command.
